# RFD 84 - Teleport Oracle Access Integration

## What


This RFD outlines the scope of Oracle integration with Teleport Database Access.
Oracle DB Access differs from currently supported database protocols by Teleport Database Access.
Namely, Oracle DB protocol is private and there is not any official documentation describing the Oracle protocol.

## Why

Adding Oracle support to Teleport Database Access would allow our shared customer bases to take advantage of Teleport's access controls and audit logging capabilities when accessing their Oracle databases.

* Administrators will be able to control access to their entire fleet of database servers through their identity provider with SSO.
* Users will be able to connect to Oracle databases with the tools they're familiar with without having to deal with passwords or shared secrets.
* Auditors will be able to view the database activity and tie it to a particular user identity within an organization.


# Scope of Integration
-- **Teleport as Oracle Access Proxy**: Teleport should be able to act like a proxy between the incoming Oracle client connection and connection to Oracle Server where the Teleport will terminate the incoming TLS connection and establish a new TLS connection to the Oracle Server using a new TLS Certificate and forward the traffic between Oracle client and server.
- **Audit Logging**: Teleport needs to be able to inspect the Oracle wire protocol to provide Teleport audit logs and audit client interaction with Oracle database.


### TLS Termination of Incoming connection:
Teleport needs to be able to TLS-terminate incoming Oracle client connection and reestablish a new TLS connection that uses Teleport-signed client certificate to the Oracle Server. Oracle database server will need to be configured to trust Teleport's certificate authority to be able to validate client connections.


## Details

### Teleport Database Access Configuration:

#### Oracle Client:

Oracle clients support TLS connections to the Oracle Server by using a custom container called [Oracle Wallet](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E92519_02/pt856pbr3/eng/pt/tsvt/concept_UnderstandingOracleWallet.html#:~:text=Oracle%20Wallet%20is%20a%20container,is%20used%20for%20security%20credentials.
) that stores authentication credentials and certificates.
Teleport `tsh db login` command for Oracle database will generate cert in Oracle Wallet format allowing to configure the wallet in Oracle database clients like [sqlplus](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/qstart.htm) or [SQL Oracle Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/)


##### UX:

Teleport will integrate with Oracle in the same way as other databases.

* `tsh db connect` - would start [sqlplus](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/qstart.htm) Oracle CLI.
* `tsh proxy db` - would start proxy for 3rd party GUI clients like  [SQL Oracle Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/)


#### Oracle Server Setup:
The new `tctl auth sign` `--format=oracle` sign format will be introduced where Teleport certificate authority and generated certificate/key pair will be stored in Oracle Wallet SSO autologin format:
```
tctl auth sign --format=oracle --host=oracle.example.com --out=server --ttl=2190h
```
Generated Oracle Wallet will be used in Oracle server [sqlnet.ora](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e10835/sqlnet.htm#NETRF416) configuration file:
```
SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = TRUE
SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES = (TCPS)
WALLET_LOCATION =
  (SOURCE =
    (METHOD = FILE)
    (METHOD_DATA =
      (DIRECTORY = /path/to/server/wallet)
    )
  )
```

and in [listener.ora](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETRF/listener.htm#NETRF008) configuration file:
```
SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = TRUE
WALLET_LOCATION =
  (SOURCE =
    (METHOD = FILE)
    (METHOD_DATA =
      (DIRECTORY =  /path/to/server/wallet)
    )
  )

LISTENER =
   (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
     (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCPS)(HOST = 0.0.0.0)(PORT = 2484))
     )
   )
```

Additionally, the following server parameters to will be set to enable TLS authentication on the server side:
\
[SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e10835/sqlnet.htm#NETRF2035)
\
[SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e10835/sqlnet.htm#NETRF233)

#### Create a OracleDB User wth TLS x509 DN Authentication:
Oracle server allows to authenticate database user based on the certificate CN field:

```azure
CREATE USER alice IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY AS 'CN=alice;
```
Ref: [Configuring Authentication Using PKI Certificates for Centrally Managed Users](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dbseg/integrating_mads_with_oracle_database.html#GUID-1EF17156-3FA4-4EDD-8DFF-F98EB3A926BF)

## Security
Teleport Oracle Database access will not differ from other supported database protocols in terms of security.
The connection between Teleport Database Agent and Oracle Server will be secured by TLS 1.2 and mutual TLS authentication.
